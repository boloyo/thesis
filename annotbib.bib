@inproceedings{qu08,
	Annote = {In this paper, the authors propose a model for representing and retreiving knowledge called a ``feature event dependency graph,'' in which events and their relevant links are represented as a weighted directional graph, allowing the graph to model time and dependency.  They propose a set of algorithms for creating and using this graph.  Knowledge patterns are retrieved as sets of event chains, keeping their context intact.  The authors argue that their model offers better performance and ease-of-use than comparable efforts.  The FEDG proposed here is similar to the technique I plan to use in modelling knowledge.},

	Annote = {This article compares several techniques for parsing and analyzing natural langauge sentences, comparing their advantages and disadvantages.  Their comparisons are based upon the primary literature in which these techniques were introduced, rather than on a practical application.  The paper also covers their implementation of a frame structure as a model for real-world objects and their algorithm for using that frame structure to build a semantic knowledge tree.  Their analyzer allows the user to build a semantic representation of a sentence and its knowledge.  I include this article for its comparison of analysis techniques and as a jumping-board to other literature.},

@book{jura00,

Topics covered include statistical parsing, tagging, grammars, semantics and meaning and a cursory overview of knowledge representation.  I used to source to learn the basics of natural langauge processing.  Much of its focus is on lower-level ideas, leaving applications and complex knowledge representation to other texts.},
