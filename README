To run this in the Scala REPL:

> import thesis._
> val sentence = Main.init // Returns a Sentence object from a sample input

From there:

> sentence.tokens // List of Token objects
> sentence.dependencies // Map of Token indices and Dependency objects where the key is the index of the governor
> sentence.parseTree // Root of the parse tree.  It's children are in parseTree.childs which is a list of ParseTreeNodes
> sentence.nodes // Alternative to traversing the tree.  This is a map of token indices and ParseTreeNodes
> sentence.entities // A map of Entity objects (built from the Named Entity Recognition in Stanford) to a list of
                    // properties.
