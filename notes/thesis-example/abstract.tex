\noindent

With the continued need to organize and automate the use of data, solutions are needed to transform unstructred text into structred information.  By treating dependency grammar functions as programming language functions, this process produces ``property maps'' which connect entities (people, places, events) with snippets of information.  These maps are used to construct a semantic graph.  By inputting Wikipedia, a large graph of information is produced representing a section of history.  The resulting graph allows a user to quickly browse a topic and view the interconnections between entities across history.
