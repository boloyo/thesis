%FIX THIS --- thank your advisor, etc., here.
I would like to thank Dr.~Lewis for being my thesis advisor and agreeing to oversee this project despite my complete lack of experience in any area I have covered here.  Our discussions on Scala over the past year have also been excellently entertaining.

In addition, I would like to thank the members of my thesis committee, Dr.~Myers, Dr.~Eggen and Dr.~Lewis.

I would like to recognize Dr.~Hicks, my academic advisor.

I would also like to thank Dr.~Massingill for her technical advice and Neal Pape of Trinity University's ITS department for his assistance in procuring a MySQL database and access to the Dias research machines.  Furthermore I would like to thank Dr.~Zhang for permitting the use of those machines.

For their open-source efforts I would like to recognize the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group and their excellent NLP library.  I would like to thank the Wikimedia Foundation for their caretaking of Wikipedia and thoughtfulness in providing such a wonderful resource in a research-friendly license.
